Templates, Generic programming
How does include work
Empty class
Linked list (2-3 variations), stack, queue, heaps
Trie (applications)
BST
Deque, vector implementation details
Hash collision
Fill leading
Operator overloading
Copy constructor            -> done
Move constructor
Rule of three
Rule of five
Structure padding
Pragmas
Ordered, unordered map
Friend function
Deep copy
Move semantics.        V  imp (bit complicated topic, may impress interviewer)
Pointer
Iterator, also how to make your own iterator (some blog). V .imp
copy elision
Smart pointers (auto, unique, weak ) : very imp 
Inheritance
Socket programming
Multi-threaded, parallel computing
Heap -> Data structures used, implement with class
AVL tree
Bitwise operations
Atomic deadlock instructions
Stl implementation
Virtual implementation
Virtual functions (internal implementation)
Threads vs fork
Distributed programming
Computer architecture: branch prediction, pipelining, cache
Linear interval implement
Long division method (square root)
Keywords: extern, volatile etc ( dekh lena aur bhi)
Rules for a class managing some resource:  “Good programming convention”
Memory pools
Na banne pe smjhaya + code karwaya interview mein
Custom iterators blog (to learn iterators)
V.imp implementation of vector (will have to do in google docs)
